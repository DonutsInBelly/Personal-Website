This is, or will be, my personal blog where I talk about Javascript things as well as other topics occasionally. I wanted to start this because I've noticed over the years that students at my alma mater, Rutgers University, are super uncomfortable learning Javascript. For most people, Python is their tool of choice, and that's OK in most cases. Some students have tried to learn Javascript on their own and they quickly become overwhelmed by the amount of things that exist in the Javascript world. They end up asking themselves questions like: should I learn Express or should I try learning React? Others get very discouraged when writing Javascript because they feel like the code they're writing is messy or ugly. I hope that some of my writings can make Javascript less scary.
